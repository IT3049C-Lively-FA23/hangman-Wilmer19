## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I deserve 10 out of 20 points. Even though my program isn't working at all, I atleast attempted it. I did 
go to the IT learning center and received help. When I comment out lines 1-10 in my Hangman.js, my program 
does run but has some issues when I insert a letter. When I try to debug the program, I noticed it is 
picking up some of my code.

## Self-Reflection:
This assignment was challenging and I could've done better. I had a lot of personal stuff going 
on the week which led me to not have enough time. I understand that I will lose points for submitting late 
but I would rather have some points than none. I will learn from this and do better for any future assignments.

### How long it took me to finish this?
5 hours
